# Why AI Is Necessary
### Gesture-Based Wizard Spellcasting Game

---

## Why AI Is Required

This project is a **C# wizard game that uses real-time hand gesture recognition**
to cast in-game spells.

AI is not used for convenience — it is an **enabling technology**.

Hand gestures are:
- Continuous and noisy
- Highly variable between users
- Dependent on real-time interpretation

AI techniques are required to:
- Interpret raw camera or sensor input
- Recognize gesture patterns
- Translate imperfect real-world movement into intentional game actions

Without AI, this project would not be feasible.

---

## AI as an Enabling Technology

Gesture recognition requires:
- Pattern recognition
- Classification under uncertainty
- Real-time decision making

These are problems that traditional rule-based systems
cannot solve reliably at scale.

AI makes this interaction possible.

## How I Use AI
### As a Teacher, Not a Shortcut

I treat AI as a **learning tool**, not a solution generator.

AI helps me:
- Understand how gesture recognition systems work
- Learn unfamiliar APIs and SDKs
- Reason about system architecture and data flow
- Explore multiple design approaches

AI functions like:
- A private tutor
- A design sounding board
- A debugging partner

## What AI Is NOT Used For

AI is **not** used to:
- Generate code I cannot explain
- Replace my design decisions
- Act as a black box solution
- Submit work I do not understand

Understanding always comes first.

## My Learning-First Workflow

When AI provides suggestions or code, I:

1. **Understand before using**  
   I ensure I can explain what the code does and why it works.

2. **Test and modify**  
   I run, break, and adapt the code to fit my game logic.

3. **Integrate intentionally**  
   AI-assisted components are integrated into a system I designed.

4. **Own the result**  
   I can extend, debug, or explain the system without AI assistance.

## Why Copy-Paste Fails Here

A copy-paste approach would not work for this project.

Gesture recognition systems:
- Vary with lighting, angles, and users
- Require tuning and iteration
- Behave unpredictably in real-time environments

Blind copying would result in:
- Unfixable bugs
- Unreliable spell casting
- A system the developer cannot explain

---

## The Real Goal

The goal is not to let AI build the game.

The goal is to:
- Become a stronger problem solver
- Design AI-adjacent systems responsibly
- Apply judgment in an AI-driven environment

AI is the tool.

I am the wizard.
