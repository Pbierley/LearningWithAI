# Using AI in ASE 485
### Responsible & Intentional AI Use

---

## Why AI Matters

- We are in the biggest technological shift since the PC and the internet  
- AI is transforming how software is designed, built, and deployed  
- ASE 485 embraces this reality instead of ignoring it

---

## Course Perspective

ASE 485 has been redesigned for the AI era:
- Focus on **system design & architecture**
- Emphasis on **problem solving with AI tools**
- Publishing and deploying real work

---

## My AI Philosophy

AI is a **tool**, not a replacement for thinking.

I use AI as:
- Tutor
- Design partner
- Pair programmer
- Debugging assistant

I do **not** use AI as:
- A black box
- A shortcut
- A substitute for understanding

---

## Key Rule

> If AI becomes the pilot and I become the passenger, learning stops.

Understanding always comes first.

---

## How I Use AI (1/3)
### System Design & Architecture

- Brainstorming architectures
- Evaluating tradeoffs
- Identifying risks (scalability, security, maintainability)
- Asking “what if” questions

Final decisions are always **mine**.

---

## How I Use AI (2/3)
### Learning & Concepts

- Explaining unfamiliar technologies
- Breaking down documentation
- Providing examples I analyze and adapt

If I can’t explain it, I don’t submit it.

---

## How I Use AI (3/3)
### Coding & Debugging

- Generating starter code
- Refactoring suggestions
- Debugging logic and errors

All code reflects **my understanding**.

---

## Deployment & Publishing

AI may help with:
- Deployment workflows
- Configuration issues
- Documentation clarity

But deployments are always validated hands-on.

---

## Academic Integrity

- Using AI without understanding = cheating
- Integrity is non-negotiable
- I can explain and modify all submitted work

---

## Why This Matters

Modern engineers are judged by:
- Problem solving
- System thinking
- Judgment

Not just typing code.

---

## The Choice

- Use AI to become a **better problem solver**
- Or copy answers and become replaceable

I choose the first.
