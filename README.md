# Why AI Is Necessary
### Gesture-Based Wizard Spellcasting Game

---

## Why AI Is Required

This project is a **C# wizard game that uses real-time hand gesture recognition**
to cast in-game spells.

AI is not used for convenience — it is an **enabling technology**.

Hand gestures are:
- Continuous and noisy
- Highly variable between users
- Dependent on real-time interpretation

AI techniques are required to:
- Interpret raw camera or sensor input
- Recognize gesture patterns
- Translate imperfect real-world movement into intentional game actions

Without AI, this project would not be feasible.

---

## AI as an Enabling Technology

Gesture recognition requires:
- Pattern recognition
- Classification under uncertainty
- Real-time decision making

These are problems that traditional rule-based systems
cannot solve reliably.

AI makes this interaction possible.

## My Learning Goals for Using AI

I use AI intentionally to support **two primary learning goals**:

1. **Learn and improve my C# skills**
2. **Refine my software design patterns and system architecture skills**

AI accelerates learning — it does not replace thinking.

---

## Learning Goal 1: Learning C#

AI helps me learn C# by:
- Explaining language features and syntax
- Clarifying object-oriented concepts
- Assisting with event-driven and real-time game logic
- Debugging C#-specific issues

I actively learn by modifying, refactoring, and explaining all AI-assisted code.

---

## Learning Goal 2: Software Design & Architecture

AI assists me by:
- Discussing software design patterns
- Exploring separation of concerns
- Reasoning about real-time system architecture
- Evaluating tradeoffs between design approaches

All architectural decisions are designed, implemented, and justified by me.

---

## How I Use AI
### As a Teacher, Not a Shortcut

AI functions as:
- A private tutor
- A design sounding board
- A debugging partner

AI is **not** used as:
- A black box
- A copy-paste solution
- A replacement for understanding

---

## My Learning-First Workflow

When AI provides suggestions or code, I:

1. **Understand before using**
2. **Test and modify**
3. **Integrate intentionally**
4. **Own the result**

If I cannot explain it, I do not submit it.

---

## Repository Visibility & Version Control

To ensure transparency and visibility:

- **All C# scripts** for this project will be committed to **GitHub**
- This allows instructors and reviewers to:
  - See my code
  - Review my architecture and design decisions
  - Track my progress over time

Some project files are **not included in GitHub**:

- Game assets (models, textures, animations)
- Engine-generated or large binary files

These files are managed using **Plastic SCM within the Unity Editor**, which is:
- Industry-standard for Unity projects
- Better suited for large binary assets
- Integrated directly into the game development workflow

This approach balances **academic transparency** with **practical game development practices**.

---

## Why Copy-Paste Fails Here

A copy-paste approach would not work for this project.

Gesture recognition systems:
- Require tuning and iteration
- Behave unpredictably in real time
- Demand understanding to debug and improve

Blind copying would result in an unmaintainable system.

---

## The Real Goal

The goal is not to let AI build the game.

The goal is to:
- Become a stronger C# developer
- Improve architectural judgment
- Learn to use AI responsibly in software engineering

AI is the tool.

I am the wizard.
