# Project Plan Presentation (PPP)
## Hand Gesture Wizard Game (C#)

**Course:** ASE 485  
**Focus:** System Design, AI-Assisted Learning, Deployment

---

## PPP Readiness Statement

By this presentation, I am prepared to demonstrate that:

- I am ready to present **capstone project goals, features, and burndown metrics**
- I am ready to explain **how I am learning with AI tools**
- I am ready to answer **technical and design questions** from stakeholders
- All project and AI-learning documentation is **publicly accessible**

---

## Project Overview

**Project:** Gesture-Based Wizard Spellcasting Game  
**Technology:** C#, Unity, Hand Gesture Recognition  
**Core Idea:**  
Players cast spells using real-world hand gestures that are recognized and translated into in-game actions.

This project combines:
- Game development
- Human–computer interaction
- AI-assisted system design

---

## Capstone Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

- Build a functional **gesture-driven gameplay system**
- Design a **campaign mode** with progression and learning
- Apply **software engineering principles** at the system level
- Demonstrate responsible and intentional **use of AI tools**

---

## Core Features (Planned)

### Gameplay Features
- Hand gesture–based spell casting
- Wizard combat system
- CPU-controlled opponents

### Campaign Features
- Progressive spell unlocking
- Learning-oriented spell introduction
- Map-based world traversal
- Increasing opponent difficulty

---

## Current State of the Project

At the time of the PPP:

- Tutorial is implemented
- Core gesture recognition pipeline is functional
- One static-difficulty CPU opponent exists

This provides a stable foundation for campaign expansion.

---

## Campaign Expansion Plan

Planned additions include:
- Spell locking and unlocking system
- Campaign map with multiple encounter nodes
- Multiple CPU opponents with scalable difficulty
- Progress tracking across the campaign

Each feature is scoped to fit sprint-based development.

---

## Metrics & Burndown Tracking

Progress will be tracked using:

- Sprint-based feature completion
- Weekly milestones aligned with ASE 485 schedule
- Clear separation of:
  - Planned
  - In Progress
  - Completed features

- Number of Features: 5

- Total Requirements: 19
- Burndown Rate: 0/19 0%

## Learning With AI – Overview

AI is a **tool for learning**, not a replacement for thinking.

I use AI to:
- Learn C# more effectively
- Refine software design patterns and architecture
- Understand gesture recognition systems
- Debug and reason about complex behavior

---

## Learning Goal 1: Learning C#

AI helps me:
- Understand C# syntax and language features
- Apply object-oriented principles correctly
- Debug event-driven and real-time game logic

All AI-assisted code is:
- Understood
- Modified
- Explainable by me

---

## Learning Goal 2: Software Design & Architecture

AI supports my learning by:
- Discussing design patterns
- Exploring system decomposition
- Evaluating architectural tradeoffs

Final decisions are:
- Designed by me
- Implemented by me
- Justified by me

---

## AI Usage Boundaries

AI is **not** used to:
- Blindly generate solutions
- Replace understanding
- Submit unexplained code

If I cannot explain or modify it, I do not use it.

---

## Version Control & Transparency

To ensure visibility:

- **All C# scripts** are hosted on **GitHub**
- Project documentation is available on **GitHub & Canvas**

Some files are excluded from GitHub:
- Game assets
- Large binary or engine-generated files

These are managed using **Plastic SCM within Unity**, following industry practice.

---

## Stakeholder Readiness

I am prepared to answer questions regarding:

- System architecture
- AI usage and limitations
- Campaign design decisions
- Progress tracking and scope control
- Ethical and responsible AI use

---

## Access to Project Materials

All relevant materials are publicly accessible:

- Source code (scripts): GitHub
- Design documents: GitHub & Canvas
- AI usage explanations: GitHub & Canvas

This ensures transparency and accountability.

---

## Summary

- Clear project goals and features
- Defined learning objectives with AI
- Measurable progress and burndown
- Transparent documentation and version control
- Readiness for stakeholder feedback
